  <head>
    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
<h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>HTML also known as HyperText Markup Language, is a programming Language to create web pages and applications for web pages. <br> HTML consists  of a series of elements and attributes which are used to mark up all the components of a document to <br> structure it in a meaningful way.  It serves as the foundational structure for all content displayed in a web browser. </p>
    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->

    <hr>
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>CSS is a language we use to design a webpage. <br> CSS focuses more on style rather than executing logic or programming. <br>  CSS is responsible for adding the color, fonts, and layout to your webpage.</p>
    <!-- Challenge 6a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p> JavaScript is a programming language that allows interactive elements inside of webpages. <br> It works along HTML and CSS in which it manipulates the content on the page for it to be interactive with the user. <br> JavaScript enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>

    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
     <h3>AFrame</h3>
<p> AFrame refers to an open-source framework for building VR experiences using HTML. <br> It provides developers with an easy way to create 3D scenes that can run on many different devices such as: a standard desktop, mobile, and VR devices. <br>  By using HTML tags, developers can declare 3D entities like boxes and spheres, making VR content accessible without having to learn complex WebGL code.  </p>
