<p>Web development involves using three core languages to build internet-based experiences. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) establishes the fundamental structure and content of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and links, much like the skeleton of a building. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation and layout, applying styles such as colors, fonts, and positioning, acting as the site's aesthetic design. JavaScript brings websites to life by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior, enabling features like animations, user input handling, and real-time content updates, providing the user experience with functionality and engagement</p>
